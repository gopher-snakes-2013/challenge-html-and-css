## Instructions

You will use HTML and CSS to recreate [this page](recreate_with_html.png).  It might be less distracting to use this [balsamic version]() of the page in version 1 and version 2 so you are focusing on learning the css and not perfect duplication. Do **NOT** worry about any dynamic interaction (drop down menu's etc) 

1. Version 1

* Recreate the text of the page using Semantic HTML. (Hint: You should only need the div, span, form, img, a, and li elements). Use a default img placeholder for images in this version so you can focus on the css.  
* Link a [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) file and your own .css file to your html. 
* Use the [box model](http://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/), [positioning](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101), [display](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/display) and [float](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101) to set up the layout. 
* Use id, class and element selectors.  Try to find two or three ways to select each element you are styling. Can you select it without adding a class or id to the HTML? 
* Validate your HTML and CSS

1. Version 2
* Use CSS to for the fonts, borders and colors. 
* Optimize your CSS
* Make it picture perfect.  Add images.  Many images on the page can be easily obtained using 'Image Information' in the developer toolbar on a live github page.

1. Version 3
* Find another page to redo.  You might look at [http://365psd.com/](http://365psd.com/) for inspiration, or your favorite social media site.  
* Start by identifying the blocks and getting the layout.
